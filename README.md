# GhostSharp

This is a [wrapper](https://grantwinney.com/what-is-an-api-wrapper-and-how-do-i-write-one/) around the [Ghost API](https://api.ghost.org), a RESTful JSON API built into the core of the Ghost blogging platform.

I like Ghost, and it's been awhile since I really flexed my C# muscles, so I decided to do this as an exercise. I really don't even have a use for it yet, so if you do, then let me know about it! Check out the [official docs](https://api.ghost.org/docs) and read about [my own experience](https://grantwinney.com/what-is-the-ghost-api/) too.

## Problems?

[Open an issue](https://github.com/grantwinney/GhostSharp/issues/new), and include errors, unexpected behavior, steps to reproduce, etc. The more details, the better! Feel free to [open a PR](https://github.com/grantwinney/GhostSharp/compare) if you'd like.

##  Ideas?

[Open an issue](https://github.com/grantwinney/GhostSharp/issues/new). I can't promise when new features or suggestions will get implemented, but I'll check them out.
